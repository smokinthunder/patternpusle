Scribble is a lightweight library for freehand drawing in Flutter supporting pressure, variable line width and more!

![Scribble Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timcreatedit/scribble/main/scribble_demo.gif)

## Installation 💻

**❗ In order to start using Scribble you must have the [Dart SDK][dart_install_link] installed on your machine.**

Install via `dart pub add`:

```sh
dart pub add scribble
```

---

## Features

* Variable line width
* Image Export
* Pen and touch pressure support
* Choose which pointers can draw (touch, pen, mouse, etc.)
* Lines get slimmer when the pen is moved more quickly
* Line eraser support
* Full undo/redo support using [value_notifier_tools](https://pub.dev/packages/value_notifier_tools)
* Sketches are fully serializable to JSON
* Export Sketches to PNG

## Usage

> You can find a full working example in the [example](./example) directory

You can create a drawing surface by adding the ``Scribble`` widget to your widget tree and passing in
a ``ScribbleNotifier``.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Scribble(
        notifier: notifier,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Use the public methods on ``ScribbleNotifier`` to control the behavior (for example from a button in the UI:

```dart
// Set color
notifier.setColor(Colors.black);

// Clear
notifier.clear();

// Undo
notifier.undo();

// Export to Image
notifier.renderImage(pixelRatio: 2.0);

// And more ... 
```

## Additional information

As mentioned above, the package is still under development, but we already use it in the app we are currently
developing.
